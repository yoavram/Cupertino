 abstract = {This paper considers the sensitivity of population growth to small changes in birth, growth, survival, and migration probabilities for an arbitrary population classification (i.e., age, instar, size, developmental stage, age, and spatial location, etc.). The stage-specific life history parameters are expressed in a discrete-time system of linear difference equations, the dominant eigenvalue of which defmes the population growth rate. The sensitivity of this eigenvalue to production of class i by class j individuals is shown to be proportional to the product of the reproductive value of stage i and the abundance of stage j in the stable stage distribution. This formula is readily computable, and several examples are presented. For the special case of age-structured populations, this formula reduces to those derived by Hamilton, Emlen, and Goodman},

@article{Grafen2006,
 abstract = {The formal Darwinism project aims to provide a mathematically rigorous basis for optimisation thinking in relation to natural selection. This paper deals with the situation in which individuals in a population belong to classes, such as sexes, or size and/or age classes. Fisher introduced the concept of reproductive value into biology to help analyse evolutionary processes of populations divided into classes. Here a rigorously defined and very general structure justifies, and shows the unity of concept behind, Fisher's uses of reproductive value as measuring the significance for evolutionary processes of (i) an individual and (ii) a class; (iii) recursively, as calculable for a parent as a sum of its shares in the reproductive values of its offspring; and (iv) as an evolutionary maximand under natural selection. The maximand is the same for all parental classes, and is a weighted sum of offspring numbers, which implies that a tradeoff in one aspect of the phenotype can legitimately be studied separately from other aspects. The Price equation, measure theory, Markov theory and positive operators contribute to the framework, which is then applied to a number of examples, including a new and fully rigorous version of Fisher's sex ratio argument. Classes may be discrete (e.g. sex), continuous (e.g. weight at fledging) or multidimensional with discrete and continuous components (e.g. sex and weight at fledging and adult tarsus length).},

@book{Otto2007,
 abstract = {Thirty years ago, biologists could get by with a rudimentary grasp of mathematics and modeling. Not so today. In seeking to answer fundamental questions about how biological systems function and change over time, the modern biologist is as likely to rely on sophisticated mathematical and computer-based models as traditional fieldwork. In this book, Sarah Otto and Troy Day provide biology students with the tools necessary to both interpret models and to build their own.The book starts at an elementary level of mathematical modeling, assuming that the reader has had high school mathematics and first-year calculus. Otto and Day then gradually build in depth and complexity, from classic models in ecology and evolution to more intricate class-structured and probabilistic models. The authors provide primers with instructive exercises to introduce readers to the more advanced subjects of linear algebra and probability theory. Through examples, they describe how models have been used to understand such topics as the spread of HIV, chaos, the age structure of a country, speciation, and extinction.Ecologists and evolutionary biologists today need enough mathematical training to be able to assess the power and limits of biological models and to develop theories and models themselves. This innovative book will be an indispensable guide to the world of mathematical models for the next generation of biologists.A how-to guide for developing new mathematical models in biologyProvides step-by-step recipes for constructing and analyzing modelsInteresting biological applicationsExplores classical models in ecology and evolutionQuestions at the end of every chapterPrimers cover important mathematical topicsExercises with answersAppendixes summarize useful rulesLabs and advanced material available},
