 abstract = {Modifier gene models are used to explore the evolution of features of organisms, such as the genetic system, that are not directly involved in the determination of fitness. Recent work has shown that a general "reduction principle" holds in models of selectively neutral modifiers of recombination, mutation, and migration. Here we present a framework for models of modifier genes that shows these reduction results to be part of a more general theory, for which recombination and mutation are special cases. The deterministic forces that affect the genetic composition of a population can be partitioned into two categories: selection and transmission. Selection includes differential viabilities, fertilities, and mating success. Imperfect transmission occurs as a result of such phenomena as recombination, mutation and migration, meiosis, gene conversion, and meiotic drive. Selectively neutral modifier genes affect transmission, and a neutral modifier gene can evolve only by generating association with selected genes whose transmission it affects. We show that, in randomly mating populations at equilibrium, imperfect transmission of selected genes allows a variance in their marginal fitnesses to be maintained. This variance in the marginal fitnesses of selected genes is what drives the evolution of neutral modifier genes. Populations with a variance in marginal fitnesses at equilibrium are always subject to invasion by modifier genes that bring about perfect transmission of the selected genes. It is also found, within certain constraints, that for modifier genes producing what we call "linear variation" in the transmission processes, a new modifier allele can invade a population at equilibrium if it reduces the level of imperfect transmission acting on the selected genes, and will be expelled if it increases the level of imperfect transmission. Moreover, the strength of the induced selection on the modifier gene is shown to range up to the order of the departure of the genetic system from perfect transmission.},

 abstract = {The spectral bound, s($\alpha$A + $\beta$V), of a combination of a resolvent positive linear operator A and an operator of multiplication V, was shown by Kato to be convex in . Kato's result is shown here to imply, through an elementary "dual convexity" lemma, that s($\alpha$A + $\beta$V) is also convex in $\alpha$ {\textgreater} 0, and notably, ∂s($\alpha$A + $\beta$V)/∂$\alpha$ ≤ s(A). Diffusions typically have s(A) ≤ 0, so that for diffusions with spatially heterogeneous growth or decay rates, greater mixing reduces growth. Models of the evolution of dispersal in particular have found this result when A is a Laplacian or second-order elliptic operator, or a nonlocal diffusion operator, implying selection for reduced dispersal. These cases are shown here to be part of a single, broadly general, "reduction" phenomenon.},

@article{Caswell1978,
 abstract = {This paper considers the sensitivity of population growth to small changes in birth, growth, survival, and migration probabilities for an arbitrary population classification (i.e., age, instar, size, developmental stage, age, and spatial location, etc.). The stage-specific life history parameters are expressed in a discrete-time system of linear difference equations, the dominant eigenvalue of which defmes the population growth rate. The sensitivity of this eigenvalue to production of class i by class j individuals is shown to be proportional to the product of the reproductive value of stage i and the abundance of stage j in the stable stage distribution. This formula is readily computable, and several examples are presented. For the special case of age-structured populations, this formula reduces to those derived by Hamilton, Emlen, and Goodman},

 abstract = {The diploid system with chromosomes MAB, MAb, MaB and Mab is at equilibrium under selection and recombination between A a and B b loci. The M locus controls this recombination. Using local analysis near the original equilibrium, the fate of a selectively neutral recombination modifying allele 'm' introduced at the 'M' locus is investigated in the cases where the selective regimes are additive, multiplicative and symmetric. It is found that if initially there is linkage disequilibrium, 'm' will increase if it produces tighter linkage between the other two loci. The existence of epistasis, either additive or multiplicative, is shown not to be sufficient for recombination to be modified at a geometric rate. {\textcopyright} 1972.},

@article{Grafen2006,
 abstract = {The formal Darwinism project aims to provide a mathematically rigorous basis for optimisation thinking in relation to natural selection. This paper deals with the situation in which individuals in a population belong to classes, such as sexes, or size and/or age classes. Fisher introduced the concept of reproductive value into biology to help analyse evolutionary processes of populations divided into classes. Here a rigorously defined and very general structure justifies, and shows the unity of concept behind, Fisher's uses of reproductive value as measuring the significance for evolutionary processes of (i) an individual and (ii) a class; (iii) recursively, as calculable for a parent as a sum of its shares in the reproductive values of its offspring; and (iv) as an evolutionary maximand under natural selection. The maximand is the same for all parental classes, and is a weighted sum of offspring numbers, which implies that a tradeoff in one aspect of the phenotype can legitimately be studied separately from other aspects. The Price equation, measure theory, Markov theory and positive operators contribute to the framework, which is then applied to a number of examples, including a new and fully rigorous version of Fisher's sex ratio argument. Classes may be discrete (e.g. sex), continuous (e.g. weight at fledging) or multidimensional with discrete and continuous components (e.g. sex and weight at fledging and adult tarsus length).},

 abstract = {A deterministic two-locus population genetic model with random mating is studied. The first locus, with two alleles, is subject to mutation and arbitrary viability selection. The second locus, with an arbitrary number of alleles, controls the mutation at the first locus. A class of viability-analogous Hardy-Weinberg equilibria is analyzed in which the selected gene and the modifier locus are in linkage equilibrium. It is shown that at these equilibria a reduction principle for the success of new mutation-modifying alleles is valid. A new allele at the modifier locus succeeds if its marginal average mutation rate is less than the mean mutation rate of the resident modifier allele evaluated at the equilibrium. Internal stability properties of these equilibria are also described.},

 abstract = {Thirty years ago, biologists could get by with a rudimentary grasp of mathematics and modeling. Not so today. In seeking to answer fundamental questions about how biological systems function and change over time, the modern biologist is as likely to rely on sophisticated mathematical and computer-based models as traditional fieldwork. In this book, Sarah Otto and Troy Day provide biology students with the tools necessary to both interpret models and to build their own.The book starts at an elementary level of mathematical modeling, assuming that the reader has had high school mathematics and first-year calculus. Otto and Day then gradually build in depth and complexity, from classic models in ecology and evolution to more intricate class-structured and probabilistic models. The authors provide primers with instructive exercises to introduce readers to the more advanced subjects of linear algebra and probability theory. Through examples, they describe how models have been used to understand such topics as the spread of HIV, chaos, the age structure of a country, speciation, and extinction.Ecologists and evolutionary biologists today need enough mathematical training to be able to assess the power and limits of biological models and to develop theories and models themselves. This innovative book will be an indispensable guide to the world of mathematical models for the next generation of biologists.A how-to guide for developing new mathematical models in biologyProvides step-by-step recipes for constructing and analyzing modelsInteresting biological applicationsExplores classical models in ecology and evolutionQuestions at the end of every chapterPrimers cover important mathematical topicsExercises with answersAppendixes summarize useful rulesLabs and advanced material available},

@article{Ram2012,
 abstract = {Numerous empirical studies show that stress of various kinds induces a state of hypermutation in bacteria via multiple mechanisms, but theoretical treatment of this intriguing phenomenon is lacking. We used deterministic and stochastic models to study the evolution of stress-induced hypermutation in infinite and finite-size populations of bacteria undergoing selection, mutation, and random genetic drift in constant environments and in changing ones. Our results suggest that if beneficial mutations occur, even rarely, then stress-induced hypermutation is advantageous for bacteria at both the individual and the population levels and that it is likely to evolve in populations of bacteria in a wide range of conditions because it is favored by selection. These results imply that mutations are not, as the current view holds, uniformly distributed in populations, but rather that mutations are more common in stressed individuals and populations. Because mutation is the raw material of evolution, these results have a profound impact on broad aspects of evolution and biology.},
